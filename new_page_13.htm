			<p><font color="#800000"><span lang="en-us">This course looks at 
			ways in which business processes can be analyzed, redesigned, and 
			improved. A business process is a set of activities that jointly 
			realize a business goal in an organizational and technical 
			environment. These processes take place in a single organization but 
			may need to interact with processes in other organizations. Business 
			process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, 
			and techniques that support the design, administration, 
			configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes. BPM is 
			concerned with the explicit representation of processes – once they 
			are defined, processes can be analyzed, improved, and enacted. 
			Software in the form of business process management systems can be 
			used to coordinate business process activities. By taking this 
			course you will be able to understand business process from a 
			general management perspective, and learn tools, analytical 
			frameworks and general principles for managing business processes. 
			The aim of this course is to introduce you to methodologies and 
			techniques of business process modeling. A main objective is to 
			increase your awareness of the concepts and foundations of business 
			process modeling and the potential to improve the efficiency and 
			effectiveness of organizations by using business process modeling</span></font></p>
